# Thrust-Vector-Controlled-Rocket
This repository contains the design process of my thrust vector-controlled rocket, including the STL, Gerber, and Ino files.

## General Overview
The rocket has an overall length of 490.75mm (19.32”), a diameter of 74.5mm (2.93”), and a total weight of 415g (14.64oz). It has four main sections: the nose cone, the avionics compartment, the main fuselage, and the thrust vector gimbals. The rocket is programmed to maintain a straight vertical trajectory by determining its orientation and correcting the direction of thrust accordingly. The rocket structure was designed in Fusion 360 and 3D printed with PLA, the PCBs were designed in EasyEDA and produced by JLCPCB, and the programming was typed and uploaded via the Arduino IDE.
